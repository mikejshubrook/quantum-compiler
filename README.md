# quantum-compiler
Quantum compilation algorithm to decompose arbitrary two qubit gates into the native gate set of different quantum computing architectures.

*** This code has not been updated since the new version of Qiskit was released ***

This code was originally written in 2021, and has not been updated to work with the new version of Qiskit. However, a demonstration of the code, as well as an explanation of the quantum compiler theory behind it, can be found in this video on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSC6NrH7Y-g&t=753s&ab_channel=MikeShubrook
