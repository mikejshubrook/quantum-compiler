    "By combining unitaries together using tensory products and sequential multiplication, we can express arbitrary quantum algorithms on $n$ qubits as a single unitary opertor in a $2^{n}$ dimensional Hilbert space. If we can express an arbitrary quantum algorithm as a unitary matrix on $n$ qubits, why can't our quantum computers just implement this gate as it is? The answer is that there is no proposed way to implement gates on anything but one or two qubits. Additionally, quantum computers have very large engineering hurdles to overcome in their current state (only implementing single and two qubit gates), so being able to perform gates on multiple qubits is very unlikely to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computation can be implemented on different engineering platforms, such as trapped ions, photons or superconducting qubits. Each of these has their own pros and cons, such as coherence time, gate fidelity, and measurement fidelity. They also all have their own native gate sets, which are the set of gates that can actually be performed on them.\n",

    "We can think of the native gate set as the 'machine language' of the quantum computer. So long as the native gate set is a universal set, then we can approximate any unitary, and therefore any quantum algorithm, on this quantum computer. For a native gate set to be universal, we mean that any unitary can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy using chains of gates in the set."

    "# What are the different steps of decomposition?\\n\",\n",
    "Say we have a quantum algorithm on $n$ qubits that we want to perform on a quantum computer. We know that this algorithm can be written as a unitary matrix belonging to the group $U \\in SU(2^{n})$. From [1] we know that this unitary can be *exactly* decomposed into a product of so called two-level unitaries. These are unitaries that only act non-trivially on two basis states. We also know that these two level unitaries can in turn be exactly decomposed into products of arbitrary single qubit gates, and a two qubit entangling gate such as the CNOT. Putting these ideas together, we find out that arbitrary quantum algorithms can be exactly decomposed into products of arbitrary single qubit gates, and two qubit entangling gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if the native gate set of our quantum computer has access to these gates, we are able to *exactly* execute *any* quantum algorithm on it. Unfortunely, no quantum computing platforms have this capability. By 'arbitrary single qubit gates', what we mean is a rotation on the Bloch sphere, by *any* angle, along *any* axis. The best that quantum computing platforms are able to do is rotations on the Bloch sphere by any angle, along two fixed, perpedicular, axes. Thankfully, though, combinations of such gates allow us to approximate the arbitrary single qubits we require.\n",
    "\n",
    "So as long as our quantum computer has access to two single qubit rotations, of arbitray angle, along two perpendicular axes of the Bloch sphere, and also has access to a two qubit entangling gate, then we can approximate any unitary with it (and therefore execute any quantum algorithm). Such a set of gates is referred to as a universal gate set."

    "We can approximate a unitary that we want to implement by chaining together more and more gates from our native gate set. The more gates we use in our approximation the better it will be. If we want to improve the fidelity of our quantum computer, should we just chain together loads and loads of gates from the native gate set, to approximate the unitaries making up the quantum algorithm as closely as possible? No. That idea ignores the fact that each time we phyiscally implement a gate from the native gate set, there is some error associated with it. For this reason, there will be a trade off in the number of gates we use to approximate the unitary that represents the quantum algorithm we want to implement: more gates means that we get a better approximation, but more gates also means more error is accumulated."

    "In this file, we will run two different quantum circuits using the qiskit library. One will run the random two qubit gates as they are, and the other will decompose them into gates that can actually be performed on a trapped ion quantum computer. We will also add noise to this decomposed circuit, to simulate the errors that qubits in real systems pick up (in the form of decoherence, gate errors, and measurement errors). At the end, we run both circuits (ideal and noisy) and then compare the output states from the two. In this way, we can calculate the fidelity of our decomposed circuit, using the Uhlmann's measure of state fidelity [2].\n",

    "We can then decide on a reasonable fidelity, say 95%, and define the quantum volume as $nm$, provided that the fidelity is above 95%.\n",

We hope that this file will be interesting for users to play around with, and will also provide a good understanding of quantum gate decomposition.
